			<h2>How do these work?</h2>
			<p>Although said object may not be considered as "computing device", they could still exchange data and other information as they are enebled either by the internet, Bluetooth or even near-field communications or NFC through embedded sensors.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="receives">
			<h2>Who receives the data?</h2>
			<p>According to IIOT World, the person or entity who holds ownership to the IOT device, in the sense that they were the ones who patented and manufactured it, would receive the data from these devices and the "data subjects" which are the users of these devices like us.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="owns">
			<h2>Who owns the data collected?</h2>
			<p>Besed on laws implemented to protect the users' privacy rights, it is stated that the customers or data subjects will always have the rights to the information collected by IOT devices. Now, it should be noted that because of this, we should all be aware that as consumers, it is our right to be informed on how data from us is collected and how this is used by those who receive it.</p>
